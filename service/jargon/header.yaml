# This is the default Pyfa jargon file.
#
# It is essentially a giant set of find/replace statements in order to translate
# abbreviated Eve community terms into more useful full terms. It is intended
# for translation of strings such as "haml 2" "into "Heavy Assault Missile Launcher II"..
#
# These abbreviations are not case-sensitive. If abbreviations collide, the
# later one is used.
#
# Abbreviations with spaces are not supported.
#
# Syntax:
#
#   abbreviation: full name
#
# The default jargon definitions are stored in Pyfa itself as well, and are
# listed here for convenience overriding them. To disable a jargon definition,
# set it as an empty string. For example, if you do not want "web" to return
# anything containing "stasis":
#
#   web: ""
